# Color variants

> Bootstrap includes several button variants, each serving its own semantic purpose, with a few extras thrown in for more control.

The bundle's default variant is `default`. This provides the option to use an additional variant that is adapted to the design.

If there are additional colors in a customized version of the Bootstrap Framework, these can naturally also be used.
